## Notes

Quick sort is based on the divide-and-conquer approach based on the idea of choosing one element as a pivot element and partitioning the array around it such that: Left side of pivot contains all the elements that are less than the pivot element Right side contains all elements greater than the pivot

It reduces the space complexity and removes the use of the auxiliary array that is used in merge sort. Selecting a random pivot in an array results in an improved time complexity in most of the cases.
```
int partition ( int A[],int start ,int end) {
    int i = start + 1;
    int piv = A[start] ;            //make the first element as pivot element.
    for(int j =start + 1; j <= end ; j++ )  {
    /*rearrange the array by putting elements which are less than pivot
       on one side and which are greater that on other. */

          if ( A[ j ] < piv) {
                 swap (A[ i ],A [ j ]);
            i += 1;
        }
   }
   swap ( A[ start ] ,A[ i-1 ] ) ;  //put the pivot element in its proper place.
   return i-1;                      //return the position of the pivot
}
```
Now, let us see the recursive function Quick_sort :
```
void quick_sort ( int A[ ] ,int start , int end ) {
   if( start < end ) {
        //stores the position of pivot element
         int piv_pos = partition (A,start , end ) ;     
         quick_sort (A,start , piv_pos -1);    //sorts the left side of pivot.
         quick_sort ( A,piv_pos +1 , end) ; //sorts the right side of pivot.
   }
}
```
